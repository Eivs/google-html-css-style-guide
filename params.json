They are marked by the triangle icon, which you see here on your left. Click it now.You should see “Hooray” appear below.**\r\n        \r\nHooray! Now you know you can expand points to get more details. Alternatively, there’s a “toggle all” at thetop of this document.\r\n  \r\n##Background##\r\n      \r\nThis document defines formatting and style rules for HTML and CSS. It aims at improving collaboration, code quality, and enabling supporting infrastructure. It applies to raw, working files that use HTML and CSS, including GSS files. Tools are free to obfuscate, minify, and compile as long as the general code quality is maintained.\r\n\r\n##通用样式规则##\r\n\r\n###协议###\r\n\r\n**省略嵌入资源的协议。**\r\n\r\nOmit the protocol portion (`http:`, `https:`) from URLs pointing to images and other media files, style sheets, and scripts unless the respective files are not available over both protocols.\r\n\r\nOmitting the protocol—which makes the URLrelative—prevents mixed content issues and results in minor file size savings.\r\n\r\n    <!-- 不推荐 -->\r\n    <script src=\"http://www.google.com/js/gweb/analytics/autotrack.js\"></script>\r\n    <!-- 推荐 -->\r\n    <script src=\"//www.google.com/js/gweb/analytics/autotrack.js\"></script>\r\n    /* 不推荐 */\r\n    .example {\r\n      background: url(http://www.google.com/images/example);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n##通用格式化规则##\r\n\r\n###缩进###\r\n      \r\n**使用两个空格。**\r\n      \r\n不要使用 tab 或者混用 tab 加空格的方式作为缩进。\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Fantastic\r\n      <li>Great\r\n    </ul>\r\n    .example {\r\n      color: blue;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n###大小写###\r\n      \r\n**只使用小写。**\r\n      \r\nAll code has to be lowercase: This applies to element names, attributes, attribute values (unless text/CDATA), selectors, properties, and property values (with the exception of strings).\r\n\r\n    <!-- 不推荐 -->\r\n    <A HREF=\"/\">Home</A>\r\n\r\n    <!-- 推荐 -->\r\n    <img src=\"google.png\" alt=\"Google\">\r\n\r\n###尾随空格###\r\n      \r\n**Remove trailing white spaces.**\r\n      \r\nTrailing white spaces are unnecessary and can complicate diffs.\r\n\r\n    <!-- 不推荐 -->\r\n    <p>What?_\r\n    <!-- 推荐 -->\r\n    <p>Yes please.\r\n\r\n##通用 Meta 规则##\r\n\r\n###编码###\r\n      \r\n**使用 UTF-8 (no BOM) 编码。**\r\n      \r\nMake sure your editor uses UTF-8 as character encoding, without a byte order mark.\r\n\r\nSpecify the encoding in HTML templates and documents via `<meta charset=\"utf-8\">`. Do not specify the encoding of style sheets as these assume UTF-8.\r\n\r\n(More on encodings and when and how to specify them can be found in [Character Sets &amp; Encodings in XHTML, HTML and CSS](http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/en/all.html)\r\n\r\n###注释###\r\n      \r\n**Explain code as needed, where possible.**\r\n      \r\nUse comments to explain code: What does it cover, what purpose does it serve, why is respective solution used or preferred?\r\n\r\n(This item is optional as it is not deemed a realistic expectation to always demand fully documented code. Mileage may vary heavily for HTML and CSS code and depends on the project’s complexity.)\r\n\r\n###待办事项###\r\n      \r\n**Mark todos and action items with `TODO`.**\r\n      \r\nHighlight todos by using the keyword `TODO` only, not other common formats like `@@`.\r\n\r\nAppend a contact (username or mailing list) in parentheses as with the format `TODO(contact)`.\r\n\r\nAppend action items after a colon as in `TODO: action item`.\r\n        \r\n    {# TODO(john.doe): revisit centering #}\r\n    <center>Test</center>\r\n    <!-- TODO: remove optional tags -->\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Apples</li>\r\n      <li>Oranges</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n##HTML 风格规则##\r\n\r\n###文档类型###\r\n      \r\n**使用 HTML5。**\r\n      \r\nHTML5 (HTML syntax) is preferred for all HTML documents: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.\r\n\r\n(It’s recommended to use HTML, as `text/html`. Do not use XHTML. XHTML, as [`application/xhtml+xml`](http://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml), lacks both browser and infrastructure support and offers less room for optimization than HTML.)\r\n\r\nAlthough fine with HTML, do not close void elements, i.e. write `<br>`, not `<br />`.\r\n\r\n###HTML validity###\r\n      \r\n**Use valid HTML where possible.**\r\n      \r\nUse valid HTML code unless that is not possible due to otherwise unattainable performance goals regarding file size.\r\n\r\nUse tools such as the [W3C HTML validator](http://validator.w3.org/nu/) to test.\r\n\r\nUsing valid HTML is a measurable baseline quality attribute that contributes to learning about technical requirements and constraints, and that ensures proper HTML usage.\r\n\r\n    <!-- 不推荐 -->\r\n    <title>Test</title>\r\n    <article>This is only a test.\r\n\r\n    <!-- 推荐 -->\r\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\r\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n    <title>Test</title>\r\n    <article>This is only a test.</article>\r\n\r\n###语义化###\r\n      \r\n**Use HTML according to its purpose.**\r\n      \r\nUse elements (sometimes incorrectly called “tags”) for what they have been created for. For example, use heading elements for headings, `p` elements for paragraphs, `a` elements for anchors, etc.\r\n\r\nUsing HTML according to its purpose is important for accessibility, reuse, and code efficiency reasons.\r\n        \r\n    <!-- 不推荐 -->\r\n    <div onclick=\"goToRecommendations();\">All recommendations</div>\r\n    <!-- 推荐 -->\r\n    <a href=\"recommendations/\">All recommendations</a>\r\n\r\n###Multimedia fallback###\r\n      \r\n**Provide alternative contents for multimedia.**\r\n      \r\nFor multimedia, such as images, videos, animated objects via `canvas`, make sure to offer alternative access. For images that means use of meaningful alternative text (`alt`) and for video and audio transcripts and captions, if available.\r\n\r\nProviding alternative contents is important for accessibility reasons: A blind user has few cues to tell what an image is about without `@alt`, and other users may have no way of understanding what video or audio contents are about either.\r\n\r\n(For images whose `alt` attributes would introduce redundancy, and for images whose purpose is purely decorative which you cannot immediately use CSS for, use no alternative text, as in `alt=\"\"`.)\r\n        \r\n    <!-- 不推荐 -->\r\n    <img src=\"spreadsheet.png\">\r\n    <!-- 推荐 -->\r\n    <img src=\"spreadsheet.png\" alt=\"Spreadsheet screenshot.\">\r\n\r\n###Separation of concerns###\r\n      \r\n**Separate structure from presentation from behavior.**\r\n      \r\nStrictly keep structure (markup), presentation (styling), and behavior (scripting) apart, and try to keep the interaction between the three to an absolute minimum.\r\n\r\nThat is, make sure documents and templates contain only HTML and HTML that is solely serving structural purposes. Move everything presentational into style sheets, and everything behavioral into scripts. \r\n\r\nIn addition, keep the contact area as small as possible by linking as few style sheets and scripts as possible from documents and templates.\r\n\r\nSeparating structure from presentation from behavior is important for maintenance reasons. It is always more expensive to change HTML documents and templates than it is to update style sheets and scripts.\r\n        \r\n    <!-- 不推荐 -->\r\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\r\n    <title>HTML sucks</title>\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"base.css\" media=\"screen\">\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"grid.css\" media=\"screen\">\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"print.css\" media=\"print\">\r\n    <h1 style=\"font-size: 1em;\">HTML sucks</h1>\r\n    <p>I’ve read about this on a few sites but now I’m sure:\r\n      <u>HTML is stupid!!1</u>\r\n    <center>I can’t believe there’s no way to control the styling of\r\n      my website without doing everything all over again!</center>\r\n    <!-- 推荐 -->\r\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\r\n    <title>My first CSS-only redesign</title>\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"default.css\">\r\n    <h1>My first CSS-only redesign</h1>\r\n    <p>I’ve read about this on a few sites but today I’m actually\r\n      doing it: separating concerns and avoiding anything in the HTML of\r\n      my website that is presentational.\r\n    <p>It’s awesome!\r\n\r\n###Entity references###\r\n      \r\n**Do not use entity references.**\r\n      \r\nThere is no need to use entity references like `&amp;mdash;`, `&amp;rdquo;`, or `&amp;#x263a;`, assuming the same encoding (UTF-8) is used for files and editors as well as among teams.\r\n\r\nThe only exceptions apply to characters with special meaning in HTML (like `<` and `&amp;`) as well as control or “invisible” characters (like no-break spaces).\r\n\r\n    <!-- 不推荐 -->\r\n    The currency symbol for the Euro is &amp;ldquo;&amp;eur;&amp;rdquo;.\r\n    <!-- 推荐 -->\r\n    The currency symbol for the Euro is “€”.\r\n\r\n###Optional tags###\r\n      \r\n**Omit optional tags (optional).**\r\n      \r\nFor file size optimization and scannability purposes, consider omitting optional tags. The [HTML5 specification](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#syntax-tag-omission) defines what tags can be omitted.\r\n\r\n(This approach may require a grace period to be established as a wider guideline as it’s significantly different from what web developers are typically taught. For consistency and simplicity reasons it’s best served omitting all optional tags, not just a selection.)\r\n\r\n    <!-- 不推荐 -->\r\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\r\n    <html>\r\n      <head>\r\n        <title>Spending money, spending bytes</title>\r\n      </head>\r\n      <body>\r\n        <p>Sic.</p>\r\n      </body>\r\n    </html>\r\n    <!-- 推荐 -->\r\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\r\n    <title>Saving money, saving bytes</title>\r\n    <p>Qed.\r\n    \r\n###type attributes###\r\n      \r\n**Omit `type` attributes for style sheets and scripts.**\r\n      \r\nDo not use `type` attributes for style sheets (unless not using CSS) and scripts (unless not using JavaScript).\r\n\r\nSpecifying `type` attributes in these contexts is not necessary as HTML5 implies [`text/css`](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#attr-style-type) and [`text/javascript`](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/scripting-1.html#attr-script-type) as defaults. This can be safely done even for older browsers.\r\n\r\n    <!-- 不推荐 -->\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"//www.google.com/css/maia.css\"\r\n      type=\"text/css\">\r\n    <!-- 推荐 -->\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"//www.google.com/css/maia.css\">\r\n    <!-- 不推荐 -->\r\n    <script src=\"//www.google.com/js/gweb/analytics/autotrack.js\"\r\n      type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n    <!-- 推荐 -->\r\n    <script src=\"//www.google.com/js/gweb/analytics/autotrack.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n##HTML Formatting Rules##\r\n\r\n###General formatting###\r\n      \r\n**Use a new line for every block, list, or table element, and indent every such child element.**\r\n      \r\nIndependent of the styling of an element (as CSS allows elements to assume a different role per `display` property), put every block, list, or table element on a new line.\r\n\r\nAlso, indent them if they are child elements of a block, list, or table element.\r\n\r\n(If you run into issues around whitespace between list items it’s acceptable to put all `li` elements in one line. A linter is encouraged to throw a warning instead of an error.)\r\n\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n      <p><em>Space</em>, the final frontier.</p>\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Moe\r\n      <li>Larry\r\n      <li>Curly\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <table>\r\n      <thead>\r\n        <tr>\r\n          <th scope=\"col\">Income\r\n          <th scope=\"col\">Taxes\r\n      <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n          <td>$ 5.00\r\n          <td>$ 4.50\r\n    </table>\r\n    \r\n###HTML quotation marks###\r\n      \r\n**Use double quotation marks for attribute values where necessary.**\r\n      \r\nWhen quoting attribute values, use double (`\"\"`) rather than single quotation marks (`''`).\r\n\r\n    <!-- 不推荐 -->\r\n    <a class='maia-button maia-button-secondary'>Sign in</a>\r\n    <!-- 推荐 -->\r\n    <a class=\"maia-button maia-button-secondary\">Sign in</a>\r\n\r\n##CSS Style Rules##\r\n\r\n###CSS validity###\r\n      \r\n**Use valid CSS where possible.**\r\n      \r\nUnless dealing with CSS validator bugs or requiring proprietary syntax, use valid CSS code.\r\n\r\nUse tools such as the [W3C CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to test. Using valid CSS is a measurable baseline quality attribute that allows to spot CSS code that may not have any effect and can be removed, and that ensures proper CSS usage.\r\n\r\n###ID and class naming###\r\n      \r\n**Use meaningful or generic ID and class names.**\r\n      \r\nInstead of presentational or cryptic names, always use ID and class names that reflect the purpose of the element in question, or that are otherwise generic.\r\n\r\nNames that are specific and reflect the purpose of the element should be preferred as these are most understandable and the least likely to change.\r\n\r\nGeneric names are simply a fallback for elements that have no particular or no meaning different from their siblings. They are typically needed as “helpers.”\r\n\r\nUsing functional or generic names reduces the probability of unnecessary document or template changes.\r\n\r\n    /* 不推荐: meaningless */\r\n    #yee-1901 {}\r\n\r\n    /* 不推荐: presentational */\r\n    .button-green {}\r\n    .clear {}\r\n    /* Recommended: specific */\r\n    #gallery {}\r\n    #login {}\r\n    .video {}\r\n\r\n    /* Recommended: generic */\r\n    .aux {}\r\n    .alt {}\r\n    \r\n###ID and class name style###\r\n      \r\n**Use ID and class names that are as short as possible but as long as necessary.**\r\n      \r\nTry to convey what an ID or class is about while being as brief as possible.\r\n\r\nUsing ID and class names this way contributes to acceptable levels of understandability and code efficiency.\r\n\r\n    /* 不推荐 */\r\n    #navigation {}\r\n    .atr {}\r\n    /* Recommended */\r\n    #nav {}\r\n    .author {}\r\n\r\n###Type selectors###\r\n      \r\n**Avoid qualifying ID and class names with type selectors.**\r\n      \r\nUnless necessary (for example with helper classes), do not use element names in conjunction with IDs or classes.\r\n\r\nAvoiding unnecessary ancestor selectors is useful for [performance reasons](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/06/18/simplifying-css-selectors/).\r\n\r\n    /* 不推荐 */\r\n    ul#example {}\r\n    div.error {}\r\n    /* Recommended */\r\n    #example {}\r\n    .error {}\r\n    \r\n###Shorthand properties###\r\n      \r\n**Use shorthand properties where possible.**\r\n      \r\nSS offers a variety of [shorthand](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#shorthand) properties (like `font`) that should be used whenever possible, even in cases where only one value is explicitly set.\r\n\r\nUsing shorthand properties is useful for code efficiency and understandability.\r\n\r\n    /* 不推荐 */\r\n    border-top-style: none;\r\n    font-family: palatino, georgia, serif;\r\n    font-size: 100%;\r\n    line-height: 1.6;\r\n    padding-bottom: 2em;\r\n    padding-left: 1em;\r\n    padding-right: 1em;\r\n    padding-top: 0;\r\n    /* Recommended */\r\n    border-top: 0;\r\n    font: 100%/1.6 palatino, georgia, serif;\r\n    padding: 0 1em 2em;\r\n    \r\n###0 and units###\r\n      \r\n**Omit unit specification after “0” values.**\r\n      \r\nDo not use units after `0` values unless they are required.\r\n          \r\n    margin: 0;\r\n    padding: 0;\r\n    \r\n###Leading 0s###\r\n      \r\n**Omit leading “0”s in values.**\r\n      \r\nDo not use put `0`s in front of values or lengths between -1 and 1.\r\n\r\n    font-size: .8em;\r\n    \r\n###Hexadecimal notation###\r\n      \r\n**Use 3 character hexadecimal notation where possible.**\r\n      \r\nFor color values that permit it, 3 character hexadecimal notation is shorter and more succinct.\r\n\r\n    /* 不推荐 */\r\n    color: #eebbcc;\r\n    /* Recommended */\r\n    color: #ebc;\r\n    \r\n###Prefixes###\r\n      \r\n**Prefix selectors with an application-specific prefix (optional).**\r\n      \r\nIn large projects as well as for code that gets embedded in other projects or on external sites use prefixes (as namespaces) for ID and class names. Use short, unique identifiers followed by a dash.\r\n\r\nUsing namespaces helps preventing naming conflicts and can make maintenance easier, for example in search and replace operations.\r\n\r\n    .adw-help {} /* AdWords */\r\n    #maia-note {} /* Maia */\r\n    \r\n###ID and class name delimiters###\r\n      \r\n**Separate words in ID and class names by a hyphen.**\r\n      \r\nDo not concatenate words and abbreviations in selectors by any characters (including none at all) other than hyphens, in order to improve understanding and scannability.\r\n\r\n    /* 不推荐: does not separate the words “demo” and “image” */\r\n    .demoimage {}\r\n\r\n    /* 不推荐: uses underscore instead of hyphen */\r\n    .error_status {}\r\n\r\n    /* Recommended */\r\n    #video-id {}\r\n    .ads-sample {}\r\n    \r\n###Hacks###\r\n      \r\n**Avoid user agent detection as well as CSS “hacks”—try a different approach first.**\r\n      \r\nIt’s tempting to address styling differences over user agent detection or special CSS filters, workarounds, and hacks. Both approaches should be considered last resort in order to achieve and maintain an efficient and manageable code base. Put another way, giving detection and hacks a free pass will hurt projects in the long run as projects tend to take the way of least resistance. That is, allowing and making it easy to use detection and hacks means using detection and hacks more frequently—and more frequently is too frequently.\r\n\r\n##CSS Formatting Rules###\r\n\r\n###Declaration order###\r\n      \r\n**Alphabetize declarations.**\r\n      \r\nPut declarations in alphabetical order in order to achieve consistent code in a way that is easy to remember and maintain.\r\n\r\nIgnore vendor-specific prefixes for sorting purposes. However, multiple vendor-specific prefixes for a certain CSS property should be kept sorted (e.g. -moz prefix comes before -webkit).\r\n\r\n    background: fuchsia;\r\n    border: 1px solid;\r\n    -moz-border-radius: 4px;\r\n    -webkit-border-radius: 4px;\r\n    border-radius: 4px;\r\n    color: black;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n    text-indent: 2em;\r\n    \r\n###Block content indentation###\r\n      \r\n**Indent all block content.**\r\n      \r\nIndent all [block content](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#block), that is rules within rules as well as declarations, so to reflect hierarchy and improve understanding.\r\n\r\n    @media screen, projection {\r\n\r\n      html {\r\n        background: #fff;\r\n        color: #444;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n###Declaration stops###\r\n      \r\n**Use a semicolon after every declaration.**\r\n      \r\nEnd every declaration with a semicolon for consistency and extensibility reasons.\r\n\r\n    /* 不推荐 */\r\n    .test {\r\n      display: block;\r\n      height: 100px\r\n    }\r\n    /* Recommended */\r\n    .test {\r\n      display: block;\r\n      height: 100px;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n###Property name stops###\r\n      \r\n**Use a space after a property name’s colon.**\r\n      \r\nAlways use a single space between property and value (but no space between property and colon) for consistency reasons.\r\n\r\n    /* 不推荐 */\r\n    h3 {\r\n      font-weight:bold;\r\n    }\r\n    /* Recommended */\r\n    h3 {\r\n      font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n###Selector and declaration separation###\r\n      \r\n**Separate selectors and declarations by new lines.**\r\n      \r\nAlways start a new line for each selector and declaration.\r\n\r\n    /* 不推荐 */\r\n    a:focus, a:active {\r\n      position: relative; top: 1px;\r\n    }\r\n    /* Recommended */\r\n    h1,\r\n    h2,\r\n    h3 {\r\n      font-weight: normal;\r\n      line-height: 1.2;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n###Rule separation###\r\n      \r\n**Separate rules by new lines.**\r\n      \r\nAlways put a line between rules.\r\n\r\n    html {\r\n      background: #fff;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    body {\r\n      margin: auto;\r\n      width: 50%;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n###CSS quotation marks###\r\n      \r\n**Use single quotation marks for attribute selectors and property values where necessary.**\r\n      \r\nWhen quoting attribute selectors and property values, use single (`''`) rather than double (`\"\"`) quotation marks. Do not use quotation marks in URI values (`url()`).\r\n\r\n    /* 不推荐 */\r\n    @import url(\"//www.google.com/css/maia.css\");\r\n\r\n    html {\r\n      font-family: \"open sans\", arial, sans-serif;\r\n    }\r\n    /* Recommended */\r\n    @import url(//www.google.com/css/maia.css);\r\n\r\n    html {\r\n      font-family: 'open sans', arial, sans-serif;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n##CSS Meta Rules##\r\n\r\n###Section comments###\r\n      \r\n**Group sections by a section comment (optional).**\r\n      \r\nIf possible, group style sheet sections together by using comments. Separate sections with new lines.\r\n\r\n    /* Header */\r\n\r\n    #adw-header {}\r\n\r\n    /* Footer */\r\n\r\n    #adw-footer {}\r\n\r\n    /* Gallery */\r\n\r\n    .adw-gallery {}\r\n\r\n\r\n##PARTING_WORDS##\r\n\r\n**Be consistent.**\r\n\r\nIf you’re editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style. If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators, you should too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them, make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.\r\n\r\nThe point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you’re saying rather than on how you’re saying it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary, but local style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Avoid this.\r\n\r\nRevision 2.2","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
